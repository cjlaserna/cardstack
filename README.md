# CardStack Project
| This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was created with the intent of creating a **simple** flashcard site with **Latex** support. As time moves forward, I'll add support to other interesting components.
## Known Bugs
1. Certain characters in card set names conflict with URL and card set parameters.
2. Keyboard input on full card set view stops working after clicking off of the card.
## Future Features
1. Virtual math keyboard
2. Better code blocks
4. Ability to edit cards
5. Better verification emails
6. Supporting Pages
